<h1>just wanna say whats goin on in my head</h1>

<p>Sya, a rainy cloud</p>
<p>Task 1 CERF level is A2, keep it up.</p>

<h2>whats the purpose of all of this things :) ?</h2>
<h3>"You ask me, I ask who?"</h3>
<h4>I don't even know.</h4>

<p>It's snowing already, and it's very pretty.</p>
<h5>So glad to be home.</h5>
<h6>Very peaceful and quiet</h6>

<p>But nothing is as painful as fighting with your own mind when your heart tells different.</p>
<p>Feeling fuckin horrible</p>

<!-- Your poem section -->
<p>The moon has died,</p>
<p>The stars have died,</p>
<p>The wind has died.</p>

<p>I keep telling myself it's alright, but people really know how to ruin me.</p>
<p>My heart aches in silent plea.</p>

<p>It's a pain that I've learned to bear while masking my heartache with a painted smile.</p>
<p>Can I not shed endless tears?</p>
